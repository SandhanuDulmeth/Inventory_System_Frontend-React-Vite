# Inventory System Frontend

This project is the frontend part of an Inventory System built using React and Vite.

## Features

- **React**: Utilizes the React library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite**: Uses Vite as the build tool for faster development and optimized production builds.
- **ESLint**: Configured with some ESLint rules for maintaining code quality.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/SandhanuDulmeth/Inventory_System_Frontend-React-Vite.git
cd Inventory_System_Frontend-React-Vite
```

2. Install the dependencies:

```sh
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### Running the Development Server

Start the development server with:

```sh
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

This will start the Vite development server and you can view the application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Building for Production

To create a production build of the application, run:

```sh
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

The production-ready files will be in the `dist` folder.

## ESLint Configuration

This project includes a basic ESLint setup. To expand the ESLint configuration, especially for production applications, it is recommended to use TypeScript and enable type-aware lint rules. You can refer to the [TypeScript template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-ts) for more details.
